**Explanation:**

*   **Load Balancer 1 and Load Balancer 2:** The load balancer cluster now consists of multiple load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple web servers. This enhances scalability and ensures high availability.
    
*   **Web Server 1, Web Server 2, Web Server 3:** Adding additional web servers allows for distributing the incoming traffic among multiple instances, improving the capacity to handle more concurrent requests and increasing fault tolerance.
    
*   **Application Server 1, Application Server 2, Application Server 3:** The application servers are replicated, enabling load distribution and parallel processing of requests. This enhances scalability and reduces response time.
    
*   **Database 1, Database 2, Database 3:** Adding more database instances enables better distribution of read and write operations, increasing overall database performance and allowing for higher capacity to handle increased data load.
    

By scaling up the infrastructure with multiple instances of each component, you can handle increased traffic, enhance performance, and achieve better fault tolerance. Load balancers distribute the traffic evenly across multiple web servers, and application servers and databases work in parallel to process requests and handle data operations.
