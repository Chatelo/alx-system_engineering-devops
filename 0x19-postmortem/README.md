_Issue Summary:_

- _Duration:_
  - Start Time: 2023-11-12 15:00 UTC
  - End Time: 2023-11-12 18:30 UTC
- _Impact:_
  - The outage affected the core authentication service, rendering it inaccessible for approximately 30% of users. Users experienced login failures and delays in accessing secured resources.

_Timeline:_

- _Detection Time:_
  - 2023-11-12 15:00 UTC
  - Detected through a surge in error rates in authentication logs.
- _Actions Taken:_
  - Initial investigation focused on the authentication service logs and database connections.
  - Assumed a database failure due to recent updates.
- _Misleading Paths:_
  - Explored potential DDoS attack, leading to unnecessary firewall adjustments.
  - Considered recent code changes as the culprit, diverting attention from the actual issue.
- _Escalation:_
  - Incident escalated to the DevOps and Database teams after initial troubleshooting.
- _Resolution:_
  - Identified a surge in traffic causing database connection pool exhaustion.
  - Implemented connection pool optimizations and increased capacity.
  - Normalized authentication service performance gradually.

_Root Cause and Resolution:_

- _Root Cause:_
  - Increased traffic coupled with inefficient database connection pooling led to exhaustion, causing authentication failures.
- _Resolution:_
  - Optimized connection pooling parameters to handle increased load.
  - Increased database server capacity and fine-tuned connection timeouts.

_Corrective and Preventative Measures:_

- _Improvements/Fixes:_
  - Review and enhance monitoring for early detection of connection pool issues.
  - Implement automated scaling for critical services to handle sudden traffic spikes.
  - Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks.
- _Tasks:_
  - Implement connection pooling health checks in monitoring systems.
  - Update incident response playbook to include traffic surge scenarios.
  - Collaborate with the development team to optimize database queries impacting connection efficiency.

_Conclusion:_
In conclusion, the outage was a result of unforeseen traffic surges coupled with suboptimal connection pooling configurations. Swift identification and resolution were possible through collaborative efforts between DevOps and Database teams. Moving forward, a more proactive approach to monitoring and scaling will be adopted to ensure the seamless operation of critical services.

This incident serves as a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the importance of robust monitoring, rapid response, and collaborative problem-solving in maintaining the reliability of web stack services. The corrective measures outlined aim to fortify our systems against similar incidents and enhance our overall resilience in the face of evolving challenges.
